Application Shade for Windows


#### Have you ever wanted to darken a specific application because it has no dark theme?
#### Maybe you don't want to have to fiddle with your monitor settings at night.
#### Maybe you want a privacy shade, so people can't easily see sensitive information on your screen.
### Dimmable is the answer.
#

You can control the level of shade to overlay on the application, to change the shade after activating it, just re-launch it. 

To disable the shade, just close the app.
